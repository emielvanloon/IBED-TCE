This repo contains code and documentation of a chimpanzee foraging model.
The model is being developed by Emiel van Loon in collaboration with Karline Janmaat and Karolina Pyrycz.

Karline was involved by the first ideas to create the model, provided information on Chimpanzee behaviour and ecology and contributed field data as well as ancillary data to parameterize and run the model.  
Karolina invested in the model development during her MSc project in 2019, creating the first version of the ODD protocol and model code.
